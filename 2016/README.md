## projectSlam - 2016 (Partial)
In this directory you will find the data form Project Slam operations.

### 2016 Operations
A medium interaction honeypot was deployed with a focus on usernames and passwords. While attackers were attacking the honeypot, projectSlam was sucking up the attempts to generate a wordlist of what NOT to make your passwords.

### What is in here?
Project Slam normally updates it's data yearly with a report and dump of raw data to the public. However, since projectSlam is being publicly disclosed a partial dump is being released to give the public a baseline of what will be coming in the future.

##### projectSlamData2016(partial).txt
This is parsed data in a flat text file for use in programs and scripts.

##### projectSlamData2016(partial).xlsx
This is parsed data in Microsoft Excel format to enable the ability to filter the information in a meaningful way.

### What can I do with this?
IP addresses that attempt to log into unknown systems probably aren't IP addresses that a normal user or business would need to access. Blocking them in the firewall appliance that you utilize would be a good idea. At the very lease, you could search the passwords file to verify that any of your passwords aren't located there. These are wordlists that nefarious actors are actively using.
