Useful data and information to defend against nefarious adversaries

## What is Project Slam?
Project Slam is an initiative to utilize open source programs, operating systems and tools to aid in defending against nefarious adversaries. The overall focus is to research adversary’s behavior and utilize the data that can be captured to generate wordlists, blacklists, and expose methodologies of various threat actors that can be provided back to the public in a meaningful and useful way…

## To Do List:
✓ Create a script (python/bash) that will go through the file and automatically block all of the IPs in the files in operating system firewall.
- Implement Mac IP blocking command into ipBlocker.py script

## Tools
### ipBlocker
A Cross-Platform Python script that will block an ip address parsed from a file.
